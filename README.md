## What I Learned

I learned & get a lot experinece during the development of this interesting app.
During the development I faced a lot of issues but after searching, get a lot of knowledge about frontend & backend & their connectivity. I used grafbase very first time & get a good hand on knowledge about it, I was also facing some typescript related issues but after that get a good grisp on it too.
I learned a lot, can't tell you everything, but after the completetion of this project, I am very confident that now I can tackle MERN base proejcts & most specifically Next.js. Happy day.
